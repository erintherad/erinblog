A few months ago, I came across some really cool illustration tutorials on social media using this software called Procreate. Before then, I hadn't heard of Procreate or its cult following. I had dabbled a bit with Adobe Illustrator and Sketch but nothing ever caught nor did I ever feel comfortable using them. I've tried tablets to create digital pieces as well but I've always felt that they were clunky and hard to use, especially for a lefty like myself.

Since the pandemic, I've had an itch to try exploring illustration again. (Blame it on the ample amount of time.) Cue my birthday and I received an iPad Air with Apple Pencil. I downloaded Procreate and a set of brushes from [Gal Shir](https://galshir.com/brushes).

I generally shy away from drawing freeform since it isn't a strong suit of mine. Thinking about creating my own illustrations is a bit daunting. I like programs like Procreate because I can use a photographic reference to trace from. Today I chose to purposefully draw freeform abstract shapes to get comfortable using the brushes, controlling the pressure, and applying texture.

Sometimes ideas can be overwhelming and it helps me to simplify. I made simple square canvases to fill with organic shapes and used limited colors from selected palettes found on [colorhunt.co](https://colorhunt.co/). The exercise gave me a good idea of layer control, clip masking, use of reference photos, and more.

I'm excited to continue exploring this tool further with some project ideas in mind for 2021. Happy drawing!
