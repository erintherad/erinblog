This is the face of someone that absolutely crushed it on a full day in-person interview ending with a verbal offer. My how far we've come...

I'm so excited to announce that this August, I'll be moving forward from Indeed and taking on the role of Head of Design Systems at [project44](https://www.project44.com/). 

I'm honored to be given this new opportunity to continue my passion and obsession with design systems.

## Why the move?

As with any part of a journey, I have reached a pivotal moment of expansion and growth. Lately I've been seeking new challenges and industries to dive into and learn alongside design systems. Additionally, it's important for me to continue focusing on growth. Some ways I've developed for myself and desire moving forward:

**I am strategic and forward thinking.** I'm often planning five steps ahead and I always want to know what this year, next, and five plus has in store for me, my team, the design system, and beyond.

**I lean on innovative and empathetic practices.** I want to experiment and encourage others to create. I want to feel safe when making mistakes and learn from them to work better. I want to work with others that also have this growth mindset and constantly strive to evolve in tandem.

**I seek transparent leadership and authentic support.** I want to work with others that see the value in building a better design system and trust that I can help to shape that. I want the space and affordance to do so.

**I want to keep growing.** I want to expand myself beyond systems and into more effecient design operations, processes, and infrastructure.

The bottom line is that my desires and need for growth align with project44. It's an exciting opportunity to build out a new design system and team.

I'm sure I'll have more to come, so stay tuned!
