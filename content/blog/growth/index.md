This is the face of someone that absolutely crushed it on a full day in-person interview ending with a verbal offer. My how far we've come...

I'm so excited to announce that this August, I'll be moving forward from Indeed and taking on the role of Head of Design Systems at [project44](https://www.project44.com/). 

I'm honored to be given this new opportunity to continue my passion and obsession with design systems.

## Why the move?

If you ask the haters, they'll say it's about the money. 

And sure, it started that way with a looming $58k paycut that I refused to accept. My strategy was to obtain market value proof through _multiple_ offers but unfortunately too much bureacracy clouded paths forward at Indeed. In reality, I left a lot of equity on the table and I took a lower base salary at my new job.

_So if not the money, why move?_

Without focusing too much on the negative, what I can say is that I really saught opportunity and growth in such a way that outgrew Indeed. 

**I am strategic and forward thinking.** I'm often planning five steps ahead and I always want to know what this year, next, and five plus has in store for me, my team, the design system, and beyond.

**I lean on innovative and empathetic practices.** I want to experiment and encourage others to create. I want to feel safe when making mistakes and learn from them to work better. I want to work with others that also have this growth mindset and constantly strive to evolve in tandem.

**I seek transparent leadership and authentic support.** I want to work with others that see the value in building a better design system and trust that I can help to shape that. I want the space and affordance to do so.

**I want to keep growing.** I want to expand myself beyond systems and into more effecient design operations, processes, and infrastructure.

The bottom line is that my desires and need for growth are seen with my new role and company. It's an exciting opportunity to build out a new design system and team.

I'm sure I'll have more to come, so stay tuned!
