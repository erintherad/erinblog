Seen here is a yellow-rumped Warbler that I created recently with Procreate. These little dudes can be found all over my neighborhood. I find them directly outside my front door under the large pecan tree nibbling away at the fallen debris.

From the Travis Audubon:

> Few warblers deign to spend the winter months in North America, preferring the warm climates and easy meals of the tropics. The Yellow-rumped Warbler is a notable exception, found in great numbers across the southern and eastern United States each winter and as far north as Newfoundland.

There are so many new and interesting birds all over my neighborhood and in the greater Austin area.

## üê∂ A need + opportunity

I feel fortunate that I can take a break from work during the end of the year. It allows me to not only recharge but also enjoy some things that I usually don't have time for.

Two things that I really enjoy at this time of year are:

1. Picking out a new calendar for the next year
2. Diving into a new creative project

This year, the [artist studio](https://1canoe2.com/collections/calendars) where I usually order my calendar refills from created a dog-themed 2021 calendar. I love dogs but don't own one. I would have purchased a cat-themed calendar if they had created one but alas, that was not an option.

I spent 5.25 minutes searching for a new calendar refill elsewhere but the options were so great and overwhelming that I stopped. A bit disheartened, I set aside my search and continued to jump into my creative endeavours with Procreate...It's not too surprising that I realized I could create my own 2021 calendar using my new illustration skills.

## üóì January 2021

So here's my January 2021 calendar with the featured yellow-rumped warbler!

I like the overall look and retro feel. Special thanks to upgrading my Mac OS (ha) for some final design decisions. New Finder windows and previews in Big Sur are all rounded. When I saw my saved file in Finder, I liked the look and went back in and round the corners. (Otherwise, I do not like that preview rounds thumbnails by default. This design is bad, boo!)

Taking some principles learned in some previous illustration lessions, I kept the color palette simple and minimized the details on the bird.

I want to create a new calendar with a featured bird each month for 2021. I figured it could be a nice way to celebrate art, design, and the area that I live in. Since I'm writing this down and publishing this post, I hope to remain accountable. Wish me luck!
