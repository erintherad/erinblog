It’s been a hard emotional week.

I say this without any fear of seeming too dramatic because my emotions have been everywhere forcing me to perform olympic mind exercises in split-second tradeoffs. 

I say, with no pride, that I have managed to “keep it together” whilst internally cycling between feelings of anger, sadness, despair, confusion, love, and gratitude. 

To be clear: this post isn’t for you, dear readers. 

This post is for me. 

Writing has always been a catharsis and a tool for me to sort through my feelings and make real my lived experience. But through this writing, I know that my family, friends, and well-meaning strangers will understand _just a bit more_ on why this has been so hard for me, for others, for others like me.

## A breakdown

### Monday

I went into this week with difficult emotions. I was feeling extra salty and defensive. I was preparing myself to do some emotional labor and remind others on how tone policing is a form of sexism in the workplace. (_A story for another time…_)

I feel agitated and anxious.

### Tuesday

Today the news has reminded me that it’s been a solid year of life in a pandemic. I’m reminded that it’s been just over a year that Breonna Taylor was murdered in her sleep by police officers in Louisville, Kentucky. I think about her, others like her, social inequity and injustice and BLM.

I feel solemn and sincere.

### Wednesday morning

I wake up, open my phone and look at Twitter. I read a headline around a spa shooting in Atlanta, Georgia where 6 Asians were killed, and I abruptly put my phone down.

I feel sad but mostly numb after reading that. My mind focuses more on gun violence not the hate crime. I recall being frustrated on how this country has lost control over guns. I thought how unnecessary it was to wake and find a group of people murdered senselessly by gun violence. 

As [Dr. Jason Johnson](https://twitter.com/DrJasonJohnson/status/1373304849220128771) adaptly said: 

>“_You can purchase a gun, go out, and shoot someone the same day in Georgia, but you can't register and vote on the same day._”

I am aware and have been aware of Asian hate crimes increasing across America. But at that moment, it still feels distant and it doesn’t connect with me. I compartmentalize my feelings and began my work day.

### Wednesday evening

Work is over and I finally open my phone and read through some social and news streams. 

I stumble upon a graph breaking down [Asian hate crimes by ethnicity](https://www.ctvnews.ca/canada/statcan-survey-shows-new-evidence-of-increase-in-anti-asian-sentiment-attacks-1.5016027) and find that Koreans are the second most targeted group and have the most perceived frequency of harassment by ethnicity. Four of the eight people killed in the shooting were Korean.

I stop reading and put my phone down again. I begin to cry. The data is scaring me and it’s reinforcing a lot of trauma that I’ve always had around my race. These fears have increased over this past year. 

Many people think it’s their right to remind me of my race and ethnicity. Childhood bullies, racist boyfriends, fights with cabbies, and well-meaning strangers in the park all like to remind me of my appearance and how it is something to laugh about, be ashamed about, fight about, and argue about. 

Seeing the Asian hate-graffiti spray painted a block away from where I lived in Oakland was a constant torment and unfriendly reminder that no matter what I believe or who I am, I am nearly always unjustly stereotyped based on how I look.

Friends begin to text me. When asked how I’m doing, it’s just easier to say that “I’m better” when I’m actually full of fear inside.

### Thursday

I’m trying hard to get through my work day and not go on social media. It doesn’t work well.

No one at work seems to know how to communicate and talk on the issue. Some are sharing posts and videos of Asians in the community being violently attacked which is extremely triggering. I kindly post a reminder in a Slack channel asking others to leverage “CW” or content warning labels to help those like myself who are already emotionally overloaded.

I can’t help but scroll through my phone. I’m back on Twitter. The conversation is now on the suspect, his sex addiction, and how Asian women are fetishized and hyper sexualized.

I think of a few past examples of white men in my life who have placed me on some manic pixie dream girl / model minority pedestal. Being adopted and raised by a white family, I “speak” the culture and I have familiar mannerisms as white folk. And still, I am constantly reminded of my outward Asian appearance. It makes me other-worldly for white men to get an experience of the exotic in a safe and palatable way. 

Men still occasionally reach out to me and engage. I used to respond and make space for their feelings. I no longer practice this beneficence.

Seven of the eight people who were murdered were women.

Friends and family are texting me now. When asked how I’m doing, it’s just easier to say that “I’m better” when I’m actually raging inside.

### Friday

I’m exhausted from work. When I look up from my computer, I’m dizzy. I have a headache that has started from the beginning of the day and follows me to bed that night.

Again, I find that I am slowly consuming more information and details of the Atlanta shooting. Today I catch up on the police's stance and excuses for the suspect. I [learn](https://globalnews.ca/news/7704008/atlanta-spa-shootings-bad-day-racism/) of their own racist perspective and hateful anti-Asian t-shirts and social media posts. I’m crushed all over again.

Oddly, I think about my black and marginalized friends. My heart fills with love for them. 

Because, yeah. _I get it_. 

I get the soul crushing fear and anger and hate and despair to know that the people and the system—_that is supposed to protect us_—won’t. Instead they will create excuses that support racism and perpetuate white supremacy. 

Friends and family are continuing to text me. When asked how I’m doing, it’s just easier to say that “I’m better” when I’m actually full of anguish inside.

## Talking the talk

It’s now the weekend. I’m a bit dead inside. I’m anxious and tired. I’m desperately seeking hope and renewal.

I think about the number of phone calls to make with loved ones and grow tired. I cancel social plans. I make my husband go grocery shopping and run errands because I just can’t stand to face even the slightest injustice from strangers. 

### To my white family and friends

I hear you. You feel helpless. You think it feels ingenuine to say “I’m sorry” at moments like this. Maybe you don’t know what to say or fear to say the “wrong thing”.

_I don’t really care_. 

I don’t have anything to give to you at this moment. Recognize that and the week I've been having.

While you might feel a tad uncomfy, I feel fear. I feel scared and alone. I feel soul-crushingly sad and tired. 

White family and friends, your guilt has no place in any conversation with me. I deserve better and you can do the work to soothe and educate yourselves.

Just tell me that you love me, that I’m not alone, that you’re here for me, that you actually see me,  that you’ll always support me, that you’ll stand against Asian hate, that you’ll work to be a stronger ally and anti-racist. 

Make space for me.

### To my Asian family 

You’re not alone. You’ve got a sister who loves and cares deeply. Though my phone is blowing up, I will continue to prioritize our conversations and connections. Stay vigilant and compassionate for yourself and others. We got this.

With love,
Erin
