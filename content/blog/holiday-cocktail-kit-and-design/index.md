My bachelor degree is in professional photography illustration, which at the time, was a path towards print media, design, and photography--A kind of inbetween of online and print presence. Shortly after graduating, I put that degree to use by working for a catalog company which sold everything from gigantic cupcake molds to car covers. I photographed the products and helped with design and layout for the print and online catalog. 

Now I work purely in an online space and technology; outside th realm of the tangible. Despite that, I've managed to continue designing throughout the years. There's something so satisfying seeing designed work off the computer screen and in real life. I've created Oscar ballots, wedding invitations, fine food labels, holiday cards, and more.

With new found creative energy and a time-abundant pandemic, this year I put together a homemade seasonal cocktail kit including my own product and recipe card designs.

## ü•´ Inspiration

<img class="responsive-img-no-shadow" src="/images/uploads/2020-12-20/illustration.png" alt="Cocktail illustration" />

I found this image for free floating around on the web. It instantly reminded me of 70s style cooking books, crockpots, and bakeware. I thought of bold and curvy headings and serif fonts. I weirdly thought of molded aspics and platters of fish...ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

But I mostly thought of dinners and holiday cocktail parties. Folks gathered together in the evening with drink in hand. I picture warm lights creating a soothing ambiance in the room. I see everyone enjoying themselves and each others company. If 2020 has anything to do with it, I think back on past get-togethers with even more fondness and feelings of belonging and care.

Designing this gift is meant to invoke a warmer time where good drinks and company were easily available and celebrated. Something I don't think I will take for granted moving forward.

## Fonts

The fonts I used came from Google Fonts and Dafont.

* I used the [Yanone Kaffeesatz](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Yanone+Kaffeesatz) font for labels and headings. It had that bold, curvy 70s weighted feel with a slight modern touch.

* I used [Alike Angular](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Alike+Angular) for the body font. I knew that I wanted to work with a traditional "classy" looking serif font. I liked the subtle texture that evoked an earlier time.

* The handwritten font is called [Breathing](https://www.dafont.com/breathing.font). I liked the streaky marker-like texture and the large swoops made the font feel alive and energetic.

## ü•É Recipe Cards + Labels

I began creating an alcoholic set of recipes but then realized that I could also make a non-alcoholic set as well. Once one card was created, it was easy enough to templatize and fill in the necessary content for the others.

You can download a PDF of all the recipe cards <a href="/images/uploads/2020-12-20/holiday-cocktail-recipes.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>! 

They print out nicely on 8.5x11 sized paper creating (3) 3x5 recipe cards per sheet. I used this [Avery product](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00006HPWA/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o06_s01?ie=UTF8&psc=1) to get nice punched out 3x5 index cards straight from my home laser printer

The labels for the bottles were a division from the main design. As much as I was going for a specific feel and style, I always want my designs to feel small-batch and intentional. It was important for me to put in organic parts of the design, in this case, through the Breathing handwritten font. 2 oz bottles are also hard to read any text from. I purposefully made the labels all caps with the bold Yanone Kaffeesatz font for easy reading. In the end, the bottle labels were much more modern looking than the recipe cards.

I printed the labels on [Avery sticker paper](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B074PLFZNG/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o06_s01?ie=UTF8&psc=1). I then cut out the labels and placed them on each bottle.

## üçØ Syrup, bitters, spray

<img class="responsive-img" src="/images/uploads/2020-12-20/holiday_2.JPG" alt="Bottles" />

The recipes to create the Persimmon Simple Syrup, Coffee Pecan Bitters, and Yaupon Ginger Finishing Spray were all fairly straight forward.

The concept is simple: Choose your alcohol, spices/ingredients, and allow to steep for a certain amount of time.

The yaupon and pecans were procurred from our own backyard here in Austin. Two things I learned during the process:

1. Yaupon holds no tannins. You can steep away without that mouthy, dry aftertaste that tea usually yields.

2. Pecans are hard to open. Steel yourself with a nice pair of pliers and expect flying shell pieces everywhere.

The bitters uses local Austin bourbon from [Still](https://stillaustin.com/booze/archive/bourbon-whiskey-first-batch/). The finishing spray uses a local vodka from [Tito's](https://www.titosvodka.com/).

## üì¶ Other supplies

All of the bottles with specific tops came from Amazon.

* 2 oz [Amber bottles with droppers](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00V73OA6O/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o06_s03?ie=UTF8&psc=1)

* 2 oz [Clear bottles with lids](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B088R6QXPC/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o06_s01?ie=UTF8&psc=1)

* 2 oz [Blue bottles with sprayer](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B073DYSCX5/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o06_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)

These [9x6x2 white mailers](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08GC96SFH/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o06_s02?ie=UTF8&psc=1) were perfect in holding three bottles, recipe cards, and a gift note.

The crinkly paper filler was purchased at a local Michaels.

## üéÑ Conclusion

I had fun creating and designing this gift from start to finish. It took a good amount of thought and intention to get the end result. I hope it's a gift that keeps on giving and for others to look back and think on with fond memories. Cheers! ü•Ç
