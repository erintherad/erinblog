Well, as someone aptly put it on my social media, I'm on x-games mode.

I kicked off this new year with a new set of 12 bird designs for my 2021 calendar using Procreate. I've completed this project and am excited to share the final results.

## The deets

Being new to the area, I had seen some birds that ended up in my final design but I knew that asking other locals would yield further diverse results for the calendar. Unsurprisingly the most popular response was the famed [grackle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great-tailed_grackle). They can be seen and heard everywhere in Austin. I especially like this [Halloween set up](https://imgur.com/a/4Walzu1) in a HEB parking lot.

In my neighborhood, I see a lot of mourning and white-winged doves below the pecan trees. We have lots of warblers, parakeets, and blue jays. The first day I moved in, I looked out my window and saw a beautiful red cardinal perched on a tree branch. In the late summer evenings, when going for a walk, there's a barred owl always asking: "_Who cooks for you, who cooks for you?_"

The rest of the birds were found from other suggestions on social media and a quick look up on the [Travis Audubon website](https://travisaudubon.org/).
