When I think through the last year and everything that’s come with it, the one thing that I’ve consciously kept track of are my feelings. 

*Heading into a global pandemic?* I’m feeling anxious and fearful.  

*Chanting alongside comades at a Black Lives Matter rally?* I’m feeling angry and indignant. 

*Getting into the complexities of being a transracial adoptee?* I’m feeling sad but hopeful. 

Maybe it’s how things pan out but I’ve noticed a feeling of apathy. You can probably best see that exemplified near the end in a [recent post](https://erinthoughts.com/a-week-of-feelings/). The shootings in Atlanta hit me harder than I expected but as the weeks went beyond that time, I’ve observed some nihilistic thoughts and indifference.

Apathy is a form of burnout. Being apathetic during a pandemic is real. Being apathetic in my job is concerning. I say that objectively. 

I’m a manager and I often focus most on the people aspect of management. Feeling, at the very least, sympathetic or, at the most, empathetic is a part of my job. 

I am no guru or people expert. Sometimes I get it wrong. Sometimes I have bad days. But more often than not, I do care and I can find paths towards connection and empathy. 

When I struggle, I have some go-tos to lean on to help fight against passivity. I thought that I’d take the time to list them below for others to reference and consider when dealing with burnout and approaching apathy.

## Get physical to gain regulation

Reconnecting with my physical self can spark an awareness of how I might hold stress, tension, and sometimes pain. I’ve found solace in going for neighborhood walks (I love them so much that I’ve written about them in the form of gratitude [here](https://erinthoughts.com/gratitude-walks/).) Going for weekly hikes has also been a nice way to get outside and embrace all that my body can do for me.

Exercise can redirect negative energy and turn it for good. It can provide a sense of productivity and accomplishment. I find that my mood elevates and my stress reduces which unblocks myself from accepting others or handling disappointing outcomes.

## Get time off to gain new energy

Sometimes just getting away can really help to remind us of the world beyond the computer, the situation, the people, the place, or whatever might be the thing in front of us preventing connection. 

I often remind my team to take breaks, partake in PTO, and place their lives first before work. I try to set a good example by doing so myself. If your company offers unlimited PTO or wellness days, take advantage of them and make an effort to get out of the house and into the world.

Reconnecting with the greater world is a gentle reminder that life still chugs along regardless of those stressful work situations.

## Get mindful to gain empathy

Checking inward, towards our own feelings, might prove the most insightful when combating apathy. I find that if I can stop pushing away feelings, I can simply observe them, learn to accept them, seek to understand them, and eventually move beyond them.

I like to journal to help unlock my feelings during difficult times. Sometimes I don’t know how to begin when writing. I use prompts in these cases. I recommend [Flowers on the Moon](https://www.amazon.com/Flowers-Moon-Billy-Chapata/dp/1524860417) by Billy Chapata and [Transitions](https://www.amazon.com/Transitions-Prayers-Declarations-Changing-Life/dp/0874779952/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2LTIFFYY9PH18&dchild=1&keywords=transitions+julia+cameron&qid=1618082413&s=books&sprefix=transitions+julia+%2Cstripbooks%2C170&sr=1-1) by Julia Cameron. Both books are full of great mindful prompts directed towards self-care and mindfulness.

## Get support to gain perspective

If you have trusting partners, friends, and family it can help to talk through issues and problems. If you have the means, working with a licensed therapist can also help and challenge you to think in new ways beyond anything you’ve ever thought before. 

The beauty of sharing an experience with another, is that they will translate that experience to their own understanding. And through a conversation, you might discover new insights and understandings that weren’t previously thought of before. Fresh perspectives can help find new connections to our feelings and how we might approach a situation.

## Conclusion

Lastly, I recommend that any working professional take this [Burnout Index by Yerbo](http://burnoutindex.yerbo.co). Take it every three months and check-in with yourself. Share your results with someone trusted. Use the recommendations listed above (or in the outcomes of the survey) to help move yourself out of burnout and into a sustainable place.

Much love to everyone struggling to feel something or dealing with burnout. You're not alone.
