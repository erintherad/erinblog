I created this site in less than five minutes which includes creating, building, and deploying. Gone are the days where one struggles through all of the heavy lifting when trying to publish something as simple as a blog app.

## The deets

This site was built entirely with Gatsby JS with a Netlify CMS integration and deployment. I was able to create a basic Gatsby starter project (comes with GraphQL and MDX capabilities) and then integrate it from my GitHub account to Netlify. I enabled the CMS config through the project and am currently writing this post through Netlify's CMS admin. Enabling [Git Gateway](https://docs.netlify.com/visitor-access/git-gateway/) has allowed the process to come full circle and automagically update my GitHub project with the new content.

The community and support for both Gatsby JS and Netlify are abundant. It's one good reason why I chose to spin up a quick blog. A good walkthrough tutorial of my current site set up can be found [here](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-build-a-blog-with-gatsby-and-netlify-cms/).
