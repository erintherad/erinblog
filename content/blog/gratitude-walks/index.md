I enjoy rainy walks.

It allows me to come back to the present. I can focus on my senses and I can allow my mind to let go of intrusive thoughts and make space for the active world around me. I’m fortunate because today, it is raining.

My walks have no destination. I often meander through my neighborhood, turning corners and walking along the many avenues. There is no time limit and goal. It is only when I feel present, do I turn towards home.

*So how does one get there? How does one become more present?*

## Sound

Rain falling from the sky dampens all noise and I can just focus on the pitter-patter of water falling on leaves, on roofs, on unoccupied streets. Provided a straight path forward, I sometimes close my eyes and listen to the sounds around me. I hear the birds. There’s a low coo of a dove, the bright staccato of a finch, the comforting call of a familiar robin.

I hear the humming of a dryer turning about and traffic from the city in the distance. Both are small reminders that life carries on in the mundane and that I am a part of something larger.

## Sight

We’re especially fortunate today because it is also foggy. Like snow, the landscape starts to blend into the horizon, my preview is more focused, I look only at what is in front of me. Distracting visuals recede into the gray. There is no harsh light that attacks my vision, there are no shadows to hide unseen surprises.

I see squirrels dart between flower beds and patient cats loaf on front porches. New buds on trees reminding me that the turn of the seasons is to come...and soon. There are warm lights glowing from inside small houses and it makes everything feel comforting and cozy.

## Smell

Who hasn’t waxed poetic of the rain? It is a comforting thing to smell the freshness of wet leaves and new earth. I can pick up a faint whiff of lavender and pine. As I walk by neighboring houses, I smell Sunday morning breakfasts—pancakes and bacon.

## Feel

I don’t mind the chill on my arms because I know what it feels like to be warm. I don’t mind my soggy shoes and damp hair because I know what it feels like when I’m dry. Fat cold droplets of water splash onto my hand and I am reminded that I am alive.

## Conclusion

Hearing, seeing, smelling, feeling all bring me to appreciate the present moment. 

*So why is that so important?*

Being present helps to sooth and stabilize my emotions and internal dialogue. I find that I can make room for appreciation and gratitude. 

I feel more grounded, at peace, and re-energized. Only from this place can I be in the right mind to re-approach ongoing issues, face a new work week, engage in a difficult conversation, or gain the closure to resolve a problem.

All things serve a purpose, have meaning, and provide value. Like I said, rainy days are great for walking. They’re great for grounding, for finding peace, for reconnecting with love and for letting go. 

*What do you do to help yourself? How do you stay present?*
