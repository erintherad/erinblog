Nearly six years ago, I made the leap from my first career in art and education into web development. I had attended a coding bootcamp at [General Assembly](https://generalassemb.ly/) and I worked my way through several different industries (eCommerce, data analytics, finance, and solar energy) before finding my place focusing on design systems at my current company, Indeed.

I currently manage the five developers on my team. My job is a perfect mix of people investment, knowledge of art and technology, and product vision made real through composable components and design artifacts. We're fortunate that we get to kick off 2021 hiring--in hopes of doubling our team.

## üë©üèª‚Äçüè´ Background

Going through the job seeking experience myself really made a lasting impact and it has led me to really get behind Indeed's mission: **We help people get jobs.**

I know of the stress and anxiety during the job seeking experience. Even before trying to get into tech, I was a struggling job seeker looking for a full-time higher education position. Paying bills/loans, providing for a family, having purpose and place are all wrapped in this process. So much of a peron's identity and value can be easily justified or removed by accepting an offer or receiving a rejection.

I still vividly recall my own job seeking process as a newly certifed junior developer. I wrote a couple Medium posts even. (See [here](https://medium.com/@ErinTheRad/a-definitive-list-of-job-search-resources-bd0fee9b4632) and [here](https://startupsventurecapital.com/my-job-seeking-process-e7af518a8fdd).) It was both cathartic and resourceful to put word to my experience as I went through many job interviews beating out a sea of other well-deserving and capable junior developers.

Now, as a hiring manager myself, I see a slew of incoming junior-level developer resumes and inquiries. With an open rec for a junior-level position on my team, *I want to hire junior developers.* But to be more specific, I want to hire the best junior developers--those that will succeed and grow on my team.

Hiring is hard and sometimes we don't always get it right. But there are some things within our control that I do believe can help teams, hiring managers, and candidates. Now being on the other side, I thought it would be advantageous to take some time to convey exactly what I want to see from junior developers and how they might rise above others during their own job seeking process.

## ü´Å Must-haves

To begin with, the following recommendations are meant for junior developers new to the industry and seeking roles in frontend positions (though most of the suggestions listed below can be taken generally).

There are two things that should always be readily available for hiring managers:

* Updated resume
* GitHub account

### Resume

* Keep your resumes brief, no more than a page
* List your top language/framework skills
* I want to see where you learned tech: If that's a bootcamp, great. If you worked towards a degree, awesome. Provide me a short list of projects you worked on with ways to view more.
* Keep your previous job/career history: Just a recent/brief insight to show me where you were at and what you did
* Add contact info: LinkedIn, GitHub, blog, website, email links pleez

### GitHub Account

As a developer, your GitHub (or GitLab or BitBucket, etc) is your bread and butter. While resumes are important, this is what I am looking at directly and make a lot of hiring decisions from.

#### Code errrrr'day

I don't care if you take markdown files and write simple blog posts, I want to see that you're actively developing (outside of your time at a bootcamp). Coding regularly is your skill that needs to be constantly exercised. If I see little to no activity since your time of school or camp, I immediately flag and move on to other candidates.

#### Make small projects

Want to learn about flex or explore the differences between hex and rgba color values? Cool. Create a new repo and explore that particular topic. Explore and build stylish things with CSS only. Host your example on something like [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) and add a README with a description and some takeaways from your project.

My team builds reusable components. If you're interested in working with us, I would hope to see lots of UI development. Create your own modal or text input component. Think how you can make them scalable and modular. What are your styling considerations?

Interested in accessibility? Cool. *Show me how you are interested.* What semantic attributes are most important for screen readers and keyboard navigation? Tell me about color contrast ratios and how color-blind users are impacted.

### Other considerations

Don't be afraid to reach out directly and ask questions. I promise, hiring managers don't bite! I actually prefer and am interested more with candidates that ask good questions.

Some examples:

* What is expected from a junior developer's work on your team?
* What does support look like for your team?
* What top three technologies are important to learn for your team?

## üé† Conclusion

Every day the job market is more filled with junior developers seeking new positions with tech companies. It's hard to stand out above the rest. I hope that others can read these tips and use them to their advantage because it is important to make space and create opportunities for others. I was once there myself, so I know how hard it can be! But remember, with the right interest and intention, it is doable.

Best of luck to those seeking jobs.
